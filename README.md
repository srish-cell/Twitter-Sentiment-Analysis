# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis using tweepy API

This is a end to end flask web application created for sentiment analysis of twitter tweets by using Tweepy API to search for a particular keyword.
The **"requirements.txt"** file has been attached so you can install essential libraries. Some tools here may require lower python versions while some may work only when downgraded.I suggest you to use spyder or do run it in environments like googlecolab.

## Libraries Used:
* NLTK - NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TOOL-KIT
* PANDAS 
* XGBOOST
* KERAS
* SKLEARN
* TEXTBLOB

## How to Execute
* first clone the repository using the following code in termnial.  
**git clone https://github.com/srish-cell/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis.git**
* Then run the file **"main.py"** using python command.  
**python3 main.py**
* As this is a flask based web application you will get a link using which you can access the webpage. 

**NOTE:** 
* You can set the debugger on while developing the code/editing it but if you want to deploy it turn the debugger off.
* This app is partially functioning and tweeside.py is the separate code for twitter sentment analysis alone.
